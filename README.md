## What are the goals of this proyect?

1.  ***Beatiful user interface:***
    1.  Launch your games like the real console!
    2.  Controller compatible.
    3.  Automatic ROM parsing for game icon and name (totally offline!).
    4.  Themes.

2.  ***Faster game management:***
    1.  Easier save files transfer between emulators and users.
    2.  Delete shader caches.
    3.  Etc...

3.  ***Game preferences:***
    1.  Select your prefered _emulator_.
    2.  Select your prefered _user_.

4.  ***Simple but powerful CLI:***
    -   Run **EmuNX**, passing your game as an argument and it will run it with your prefered emulator and user.
    -   Use this in conjunction with something like **SteamRomManager** so you create the _shortcut once_ and _later edit it_ with **EmuNX**.

5.  ***Multiplatform:***
    -   Windows
    -   Linux (steamos)
